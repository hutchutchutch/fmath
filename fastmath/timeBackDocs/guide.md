Getting Started

Welcome to Alpha’s 1EdTech Platform! This guide will walk you through the initial steps required to start integrating your applications with Alpha's 1EdTech Platform. You’ll find an overview of everything you need to begin working with our APIs.



What’s Next?
The first step to using the 1EdTech Platform APIs is understanding how authentication works.
➡️ Start here: Authentication Overview

Authentication

To use Alpha's 1EdTech Platform APIs, you must authenticate your requests using an OAuth token. Here's how to get started:

Step 1: Understand Available Environments
Choose the correct Identity Provider (IDP) server based on your environment:
Production Server:
https://alpha-auth-production-idp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com
Staging Server:
https://alpha-auth-development-idp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com

Step 2: Request Client Credentials
You will need a Client ID and Client Secret pair. These credentials are environment-specific (staging or production). Request these credentials via email from one of the following:
Carlos Bonetti
Wellington Santos
Felipe Taboada
Ensure you clearly specify the environment you need credentials for.

Step 3: Generate the OAuth Token
Make a POST request to your chosen IDP server to generate an OAuth token:
curl -X POST https://<COGNITO-BASE-URL>/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<your-client-id>&client_secret=<your-client-secret>"
Replace <COGNITO-BASE-URL> with the appropriate IDP server URL from Step 1.
Replace <your-client-id> and <your-client-secret> with your credentials obtained in Step 2.

The response will look like:
{
  "access_token": "<token>",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}


Step 4: Use the Access Token
Include the generated access_token in your API requests as follows:
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Note: The token expires after the specified expires_in seconds (typically 3600 seconds or 1 hour). You must generate a new token after expiration.

Sample Application
To help you implement this process, we've created a sample application demonstrating the full authentication flow. Specifically, refer to:
Scenario 3: Machine-to-Machine Authentication
You can use this example as a practical reference for integrating authentication into your own applications.



What’s Next?
Now that you understand how authentication works, the next step is to start creating your courses.
➡️ Continue to: Creating Your Course

SSO - Single Sign-On

Apps in the Timeback ecosystem can share a SSO mechanism by using the same AWS Cognito User Pool. So, a user signed in in any Timeback app that implements SSO is also automatically logged in in other Timeback apps that comply with the Timeback SSO mechanism.

Step 1: Understand Available Environments
Choose the correct Identity Provider (IDP) server based on your environment:
Production Server:
https://alpha-auth-production-idp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com
OIDC discovery URL: https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_iDYDvuqD7/.well-known/openid-configuration 
Staging Server:
https://alpha-auth-development-idp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com
OIDC discovery URL: https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_H5aVRMERg/.well-known/openid-configuration 
Step 2: Request Client Credentials
You will need a Client ID specific for SSO. This is different from the Client ID and Secret pairs used for Machine to Machine (API to API) authentication described in the Authentication Guide. These credentials are environment-specific (staging or production). For SSO, only a Client ID is required and provided, a Client Secret is not needed. Request these credentials via email from one of the following:
Carlos Bonetti
Wellington Santos
Ege Altan
Ensure you clearly specify the environment you need credentials for and that you want to use it for SSO.
You'll also need to specify to us: 
The “Allowed callback URLs” (required)
Cognito needs at least one callback URL to redirect the user back to after authentication. This is typically the URL for the app receiving the authorization code issued by Cognito. You may use HTTPS URLs, as well as custom URL schemes.
The “Allowed sign-out URLs” (optional)
The sign-out URL is a redirect page sent by Cognito when your application signs users out. This is needed only if you want Cognito to direct signed-out users to a page other than the callback URL.
Step 3: Implement a Cognito authentication flow in your application
The steps from here depend on the language and framework used by your application. Feel free to search for material on the internet on how to do this, but we're sharing below how to do this step using React

Install dependencies
npm install oidc-client-ts react-oidc-context --save


Configure react-oidc-context with the OIDC properties of your user pool.
// index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { AuthProvider } from "react-oidc-context";

const authority = "<idpServer from step 1>";

const cognitoAuthConfig = {
  authority: authority,
  client_id: "<clientId from step 2>",
  redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/cognito",
  response_type: "code",
  scope: "email openid phone",
  metadata: {
    issuer: authority,
    authorization_endpoint: `${authority}/oauth2/authorize`,
    token_endpoint: `${authority}/oauth2/token`,
    userinfo_endpoint: `${authority}/oauth2/userinfo`,
    end_session_endpoint: `${authority}/logout`,
  }
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

// wrap the application with AuthProvider
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <AuthProvider {...cognitoAuthConfig}>
      <App />
    </AuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

Generate a sign-in button that initiates an authorization request with your user pool OIDC provider, and a sign-out button that initiates a logout request.

// App.js

import { useAuth } from "react-oidc-context";

function App() {
  const auth = useAuth();

  const signOutRedirect = () => {
    const clientId = "<clientId from Step 2>";
    const logoutUri = "<logout uri from Step 2>";
    const cognitoDomain = "<idpServer from Step 1>";
    window.location.href = `${cognitoDomain}/logout?client_id=${clientId}&logout_uri=${encodeURIComponent(logoutUri)}`;
  };

  if (auth.isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (auth.error) {
    return <div>Encountering error... {auth.error.message}</div>;
  }

  if (auth.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      <div>
        <pre> Hello: {auth.user?.profile.email} </pre>
        <pre> ID Token: {auth.user?.id_token} </pre>
        <pre> Access Token: {auth.user?.access_token} </pre>
        <pre> Refresh Token: {auth.user?.refresh_token} </pre>

        <button onClick={() => auth.removeUser()}>Sign out</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => auth.signinRedirect()}>Sign in</button>
      <button onClick={() => signOutRedirect()}>Sign out</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Troubleshooting
Login pages unavailable
If you see this issue you can change the redirect to use Google Auth directly without needing to use the Cognito login page.
Configure your app to redirect users to the following URL:

https://{COGNITO_DOMAIN}/oauth2/authorize?identity_provider=Google&response_type=code&client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={YOUR_CALLBACK_URL}&scope=email+openid+profile

Create a Course

This guide describes how to structure and create your courses using Alpha's 1EdTech Platform APIs. We'll walk you through creating courses, components (like units or modules), and subsections within those components (topics, lessons).


Understanding the Structure

Course: The top-most entity used to organize content. It directly follows the OneRoster v1.2 specification.
Component: A subsection within a course. Components can contain other components, allowing for hierarchical structures (Course > Unit > Module > Sub-Module > Lesson).

For example, you might have a broad course like “Math 5th Grade” or a more detailed course such as “1273 AP World History: Modern - PP100”. These courses are structured using components and subcomponents to organize content clearly and effectively.






Step 1: Create a Course
https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/rostering---courses/POST/ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/ 

Let's create a course for 1273 AP World History: Modern - PP100

Endpoint:
POST /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses
Example:
{
  "course": {
    "sourcedId": "1273-ap-world-history-modern-pp100",
    "status": "active",
    "title": "1273 AP World History: Modern - PP100",
    "courseCode": "APWHM-PP100",
    "grades": ["09", "10", "11", "12"],
    "subjects": ["Social Studies"],
    "subjectCodes": [],
    "org": { "sourcedId": "alpha-learn-123" },
    "level": "AP",
  }
}


Step 2: Create Components for the Course (Units)
https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/rostering---course-components/POST/ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/components 
Now let's create components for the units in our 1273 AP World History: Modern - PP100 course.

Endpoint:
POST /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/components
Example for Unit 1:
{
  "courseComponent": {
    "sourcedId": "unit-1-id",
    "status": "active",
    "dateLastModified": "2024-03-04T20:00:00.000Z",
    "title": "1. The Global Tapestry c. 1200 to c. 1450",
    "sortOrder": 1,
    "courseSourcedId": "1273-ap-world-history-modern-pp100",
    "course": { "sourcedId": "1273-ap-world-history-modern-pp100" },
    "parentComponent": null,
    "prerequisites": [],
    "prerequisiteCriteria": "ALL",
    "unlockDate": null
  }
}
Repeat for each unit in the course, incrementing sortOrder accordingly.

Step 3: Create Subcomponents for Units (Topics)
https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/rostering---course-components/POST/ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/components 
Let's create topics for Unit 1, referencing Unit 1’s sourcedId in parentComponent.
Example for first two topics in Unit 1:
{
  "courseComponent": {
    "sourcedId": "unit-1-topic-1-id",
    "status": "active",
    "dateLastModified": "2024-03-04T20:00:00.000Z",
    "title": "1. Organizer - Unit 1",
    "sortOrder": 1,
    "courseSourcedId": "1273-ap-world-history-modern-pp100",
    "course": { "sourcedId": "1273-ap-world-history-modern-pp100" },
    "parentComponent": "unit-1-id",
    "prerequisites": [],
    "prerequisiteCriteria": "ALL",
    "unlockDate": null,
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
Continue this process for all topics within each unit.

What’s Next?
Now that you understand how to create your course, the next step is to start creating content for your courses.
➡️ Continue to: Creating Content

Creating Content

This guide describes how to create content and associate it with a course using Alpha's 1EdTech Platform APIs.

Understanding the Structure

Resource: The atomic entity used to represent a learning content. It directly follows the OneRoster v1.2 specification. The Resource is a description of a learning content material, that usually includes a URL linking to the actual content (a PDF, a Video, an Article, a QTI question etc) and other metadata. A Resource can be used by multiple different courses.
Component Resource: The entity that connects a Resource to a Course Component. In order to add a Resource to a given course, you need to create a Component Resource

Step 1: Create Resources
https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/resources-management/POST/ims/oneroster/resources/v1p2/resources/  
Let’s create a resource that points to a QTI Stimulus(article, video, any supporting material for a test/activity) and QTI Test from the QTI API. This will later be connected to a course component through a Component Resource.
Endpoint:
POST /ims/oneroster/resources/v1p2/resources/


Creating a stimulus resource:
{
  "resource": {
    "status": "active",
    "metadata": {
      "type": "qti",
      "subType": "qti-stimulus", 
      "questionType": "custom",
      "language": "en-US",
      "url": "https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/api/stimuli/Stimulus_nouns-article_3-PP.1_50393c35"
    },
    "title": "L.3.1.a - Identify nouns",
    "roles": ["primary"],
    "importance": "primary",
    "vendorResourceId": "Stimulus_nouns-article_3-PP.1_50393c35",
    "vendorId": "alpha-incept",
    "applicationId": "incept"
  }
}


Creating a Test resource
{
  "resource": {
    "status": "active",
    "metadata": {
      "type": "qti",
      "subType": "qti-test", 
      "questionType": "custom",
      "language": "en-US",
      "url": "https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/api/assessment-tests/test-67aa14ec-3-PP.1"
    },
    "title": "Which word is a noun?",
    "roles": ["primary"],
    "importance": "primary",
    "vendorResourceId": "test-67aa14ec-3-PP.1",
    "vendorId": "alpha-incept",
    "applicationId": "incept"
  }
}


	
    Note:
You can check how to tag your resources with CASE standards here.

    Note:
You can create QTI questions, tests, and stimuli using our QTI API here.

Note:
Resources can (and should) include additional metadata to enhance reusability and ease of integration.
See Resources Metadata for details about recommended standard metadata.


Step 2: Associate Resources with a Course
https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/rostering---course-component-resources/POST/ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/component-resources 

For each Resource that you want to include in a Course, you need to create a ComponentResource. Repeat the step below for each Resource you want to add.

Endpoint:

POST /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/component-resources

Example payload:
{
  "componentResource": {
    "sourcedId": "unique-id-representing-this-component-resource",
    "status": "active",
    "title": "Question",
    "sortOrder": 1,
    "courseComponent": {
        "sourcedId": "component-id"
    },
    "resource": {
        "sourcedId": "resource-id"
    }
  }
}

Notice that both courseComponent.sourcedId and resource.sourcedId should be valid identifiers of the respective entities previously created.


What’s Next?
Now that you understand how to create content for your course, the next step is to create your users and enroll them.
➡️ Continue to: Users and Enrollment

Use cases
Migrating Articles to Timeback
An Article should be represented as HTML in order to be migrated to Timeback. Images, videos and other embeddable content are accepted as long as they're valid HTML. Content delivery platforms (like AlphaLearn) need to provide support to render specific HTML tags, but Timeback supports all valid XHTML.

The steps to migrate an article to Timeback are:
Store the Article HTML in QTI API using QTI Stimulus
Create a Resource in OneRoster API pointing to the QTI Stimulus
Attach the Resource to a Course in OneRoster API

1. Store the Article HTML in QTI API using QTI Stimulus

Store the article in QTI API using the endpoint as described here: Creating an Article / Shared Assessment Stimulus

Notice that, beyond the HTML content of the article, you can store any associated metadata. You'll also need to provide a title and identifier fields. The identifier should be a unique ID that is used to reference this Article/Stimulus from other tools and APIs.

The Article can then be retrieved from the QTI API by using the endpoint https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/api/stimuli/Stimulus_abstract-nouns-article_3-PP.3_360809cb (modify the “Stimulus_abstract-nouns-article_3-PP.3_360809cb” ID by the identifier you used to save your article). Notice that the response contains all saved fields and a rawXml field containing the HTML content in QTI format.

2. Create a Resource in OneRoster pointing to the QTI Stimulus

Now that the content is saved on QTI, it's necessary to create a Resource in OneRoster API so it can be consumed by students as a lesson. In order to do so, call the OneRoster endpoint as described here: Create Resources.

Make sure to set the following metadata attributes:

{
  "resource": {
    ... other resource attributes
    "metadata": {
      "type": "qti",
      "subType": "qti-stimulus",
      "url": "https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/api/stimuli/Stimulus_nouns-article_3-PP.1_50393c35"
    },
    "vendorResourceId": "Stimulus_nouns-article_3-PP.1_50393c35",
  }
}


Explanation:
metadata.type specifies that this content is stored in QTI format
metadata.subType specifies that this QTI content is a QTI Stimulus
metadata.url specifies where the content is stored
vendorResourceId specifies the ID attributed to this resource on the storage provider (the QTI Stimulus ID, in our example)

3. Attach the Resource to a Course

With the Resource created, it can now be consumed by students as a “lesson”. But it's still necessary to attach this Resource to a particular course. For example, to attach this Resource to a particular Topic/Unit of an existing course (created previously following the steps described here), follow the steps described here: Associate Resources with a Course

This same Resource can be reused by multiple Courses, if desired.
Migrating Videos to Timeback
There's two ways of adding videos to Timeback:
As standalone lessons
As part of articles

To create the video as a standalone lesson, simply create a Resource in OneRoster, using the metadata.type as video and the url to be a link to the video file. The link needs to be publicly accessible. The link can be a YouTube URL link. Then attach the Resource to a course following the same instructions as previously stated in this guide.

To add a video as part of an HTML article, use the previous guide to create an article as a HTML QTI Stimulus and use the following tag options to embed the video:

Use an embedded youtube video as an iframe

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjnlymFLSdM?si=M6iCBsang_qsnwLI" ...></iframe>

Use an embedded direct video link

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
<source src="https://example.com/path-to-your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Resources Metadata

Here’s a breakdown of the metadata fields we recommend using when creating resources. Adding good metadata makes your content easier to organize, search, and align with learning objectives.
Start with the Common Metadata section—these fields apply to all types of resources. Then, depending on the type of content you’re working with (like a QTI question, video, or document), check out the more specific fields for that type.
You can also add your own custom fields if you need to store anything extra. The goal is to make your resources as useful and reusable as possible

Tagging Content with CASE

1EdTech’s Competencies and Academic Standards Exchange (CASE) is a standard for consistently tagging, organizing, and tracking academic standards, competencies, and skills across a digital learning ecosystem.
By associating learning resources with defined outcomes (like standards or skills), CASE enables educators and learners to:
Easily search for standards-aligned resources
Design personalized instruction
Monitor progress toward mastery

Checking Available Standards 

You can explore the list of standards currently available in the TimeBack platform via the following API endpoint:
https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar?api=case-api#tag/case---learning-standards/GET/ims/case/v1p1/CFDocuments 
Endpoint:
GET /ims/case/v1p1/CFDocuments


 
Note:
If the standard you want to use is not in TimeBack, you can request that it be inserted by emailing Carlos Bonetti or Wellington Santos.

Note:
You can check other possible CASE Standards on CASE Network

Retrieving Skills from a Standard

Each CASE standard contains a list of skills, known as CFItems.

Step 1: Get the Standard ID
There are two ways to obtain a standard’s identifier (also called sourcedId):

From the CASE Network: Locate the standard and copy the Identifier field.



From the API (as above): Use the CFDocuments endpoint to list available standards and copy the sourcedId.



Step 2: Get the Skills
Once you have the sourcedId, call the following endpoint:

https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar?api=case-api#tag/case---learning-standards/GET/ims/case/v1p1/CFPackages/%7BsourcedId%7D 
Endpoint:
GET /ims/case/v1p1/CFPackages/{sourcedId}


This will return the full standard, including its associated CFItems, which you can use as learning objectives when tagging content.

Tagging Your Content with Case

CASE tags are added via the learningObjectiveSet field in the resource’s metadata.

A. Tagging when Creating the Resource
Include the CASE metadata during Resource Creation:

Example:

{
  "resource": {
    "status": "active",
    "metadata": {
      "type": "qti",
      "subType": "qti-stimulus",
      "questionType": "custom",
      "language": "en-US",
      "url": "https://qti.alpha-1edtech.com/api/stimuli/Stimulus_nouns-article_3-PP.1_50393c35",
      "learningObjectiveSet": [
        {
          "source": "CASE",
          "learningObjectiveIds": [
            "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
            "fc6a7e3d-9a9f-4ef4-a3c6-dfa3b2c78cba"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "title": "L.3.1.a - Identify nouns",
    "roles": ["primary"],
    "importance": "primary",
    "vendorResourceId": "Stimulus_nouns-article_3-PP.1_50393c35",
    "vendorId": "alpha-incept",
    "applicationId": "incept",
    "sortOrder": 0
  }
}



B. Tagging After the Resource is Already Created

To tag an existing resource with CASE objectives, update it using the following endpoint:

https://api.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/resources-management/PUT/ims/oneroster/resources/v1p2/resources/%7BsourcedId%7D 


Endpoint:
PUT /ims/oneroster/resources/v1p2/resources/{sourcedId}

Example:
{
  "resource": {
    "metadata": {
      "learningObjectiveSet": [
        {
          "source": "CASE",
          "learningObjectiveIds": [
            "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
            "fc6a7e3d-9a9f-4ef4-a3c6-dfa3b2c78cba"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

Users and Enrollment

This guide describes how to create a student user in Alpha's 1EdTech Platform APIs and enroll them in courses.

Understanding the Structure

User (OneRoster 1.2): The user entity can be a student, teacher, parent, guardian, administrator and others. Each student will have a User object representing it.
Class (OneRoster 1.2): Represents a specific offering of a Course within a given academic session at a school, grouping all enrolled users (e.g., students, teachers).
Enrollment (OneRoster 1.2): Denotes the membership of a User in a particular Class, specifying the user’s role in that class (such as student, teacher, guardian, administrator, etc.) along with optional beginDate/endDate to indicate the active participation period.

Step 1: Create a user with student role

What’s Next?
Now that you created your users and enrolled them, the next step is to save the grades and update the progress of the students.
➡️ Continue to: Grades and Progress

Grades and Progress

This guide describes how to store student progress and grades.

Understanding the Structure
Assessment Line Item: This represents a learning content being graded. It directly follows the OneRoster v1.2 specification. Each activity that should be graded or have progress tracked must be represented by an ALI (Assessment Line Item). The ALI holds a reference to either a course Component or Component Resource. A single ComponentResource can have multiple associated ALI objects, allowing to represent granular item results inside an atomic activity (like individual questions inside a test)
Assessment Result: The entity that represents a student result. It directly follows the OneRoster v1.2 specification. It stores the score, status and some other metadata information, as well as the relation with the Assessment Line Item.

Step 1: Create an Assessment Line Item
https://staging.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/gradebook---assessment-line-items/POST/ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentLineItems/ 
Endpoint:
POST /ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentLineItems/

Payload Example:

{
    "assessmentLineItem": {
        "status": "active",
        "title": "Test 1",
        "componentResource": {
            "sourcedId": "pp1-unit1-test1-question2-component1"
        }
    }
}

Notice that componentResource.sourcedId must be a valid ComponentResource identifier that was previously created

Step 2: Create a Result for a Student
https://staging.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/gradebook---assessment-results/POST/ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentResults/ 
Endpoint:
/ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentResults/

Payload Example:

{
    "assessmentResult": {
        "status": "active",
        "assessmentLineItem": {
            "sourcedId": "cd1fe2be-3893-4b1e-889b-f1227a406e3e"
        },
        "student": {
            "sourcedId": "e4bc1331-2551-47da-8f28-b700accd130e"
        },
        "scoreDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "scoreStatus": "fully graded"
    }
}

Notice that assessmentLineItem.sourcedId must be a valid Assessment Line Item identifier that was previously created (same for student).

Use Cases
Represent a test/assessment results

A test (or assessment) is usually composed of multiple questions. We want to store not only the final score of students in a test, but also each individual question score, so we know exactly what questions the student got right or wrong. To accomplish that, we can use a combination of AssessmentLineItem (ALI) and AssessmentResult (AR) leveraging the “parent” field on ALI to create parent-child relationships.

Consider a “Math STAAR G3.4”, for example, composed of 3 questions. We need 4 ALI objects to represent the test plus each question of the test:
1 ALI object with title “Math STAAR G3.4”
Consider the assigned ID as being “T1”, for example
3 ALI object with titles “Question 1”, “Question 2”, “Question 3” and parent field set as being the ID of the ALI object representing the test
The “parent” field is important to create the correct hierarchy
Consider the assigned IDs as being “T1-Q1”, "T1-Q2” and “T1-Q3”, for example

Having the ALIs created once, they can be reused for all students taking the test. So considering Student A and student B have taken the test, Student A got 100% accuracy and student B got 66% accuracy. This can be saved on timeback like so:

For Student A:
Create an AR object with “assessmentLineItem” field set as “T1” (pointing to the test). Save score as 100 and all other necessary fields (minScore 0 and maxScore 100, for example); also set the student ID
Create 3 AR objects with “assessmentLineItem” fields set as “T1-Q1”, "T1-Q2” and “T1-Q3”, one for each responded question, all of them having score 1, minScore 0 and maxScore 1; also set the student ID

For Student B:
Create an AR object with “assessmentLineItem” field set as “T1” (pointing to the test). Save score as 66 and all other necessary fields (minScore 0 and maxScore 100, for example); also set the student ID
Create 3 AR objects with “assessmentLineItem” fields set as “T1-Q1”, "T1-Q2” and “T1-Q3”, one for each responded question, 2 of them having score 1 and other having score 0, minScore 0 and maxScore 1; also set the student ID

This model doesn't depend on having the test or question content themselves on timeback API. We can use AssessmentLineItem to represent physical, non-digital activities or activities we don't have the content migrated to Timeback, like a NWEA MAP test. Having ALIs for each question is also optional - if we have access only to the final score, we don't need to create the extra granular layer to save each individual question information.

XP, Accuracy and Mastery

This guide describes how to store XP, Accuracy and Mastery in OneRoster structure.

Understanding the Structure
See Grades and Progress
Assigned XP, Accuracy and Mastery are saved in the AssessmentResult object that represents a student result in a given activity, in the metadata attribute
These metrics can be saved either manually or automatically by PowerPath
Base XP provided by resources are saved in the Resource object in the metadata.xp attribute (the base XP is assigned to students that complete this Resource, after some multiplier calculation handler by the client or PowerPath)

Create an AssessmentResult with XP, Accuracy and Mastery metrics manually
https://staging.alpha-1edtech.com/scalar#tag/gradebook---assessment-results/POST/ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentResults/ 
Endpoint:
/ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentResults/

Payload Example:

{
    "assessmentResult": {
        "status": "active",
        "assessmentLineItem": {
            "sourcedId": "cd1fe2be-3893-4b1e-889b-f1227a406e3e"
        },
        "student": {
            "sourcedId": "e4bc1331-2551-47da-8f28-b700accd130e"
        },
        "scoreDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "scoreStatus": "fully graded",
        "metadata": {
             "masteredUnits": 1,
"totalQuestions": 12,
"correctQuestions": 11,
"accuracy": 91.66666666666666,
"xp": 100,
"multiplier": 1
        }
    }
}

masteredUnits: number of units mastered provided by this activity result - Mastery is defined by the client app
totalQuestions: number of questions answered in this activity
correctQuestions: number of correct answers in this activity
accuracy: correct questions over total questions in the context of this activity
xp: total XP assigned to to the user, provided by this activity result
multiplier: the multiplier used on the Resource’s metadata.xp (base XP) to calculate the assigned xp above.

Automatic XP and metrics Calculation by Powerpath
PowerPath will automatically store and manage XP, Mastery and Accuracy metrics when using the updateStudentQuestionResponse and associated endpoints.

For XP assigning and calculation, the Resource that represents a QTI Test has to include a metadata.xp number, which serves as the “base XP” that can get assigned to students that complete that test. This also works similarly for any Resource type (test or not) that includes metadata.xp. PowerPath will apply a multiplier to that number before assigning the XP to the student, taking into account accuracy and attempts using the following rules:

For the 1st attempt:
100% accuracy = 1.25x multiplier
80-99% accuracy = 1.0x multiplier
0-79% accuracy = 0x multiplier (no xp)
For the 2nd+ attempt:
100% accuracy = 1.0x multiplier
80-99% accuracy = 0.5x multiplier
0-79% accuracy = 0x multiplier (no xp)

PowerPath assigns XP at the lesson level, meaning students will get XP after completing a whole test, not for each individual question.

PowerPath
PowerPath is a convenience API layer built on top of 1EdTech (more specifically, OneRoster and QTI), that helps apps to use learning science to accelerate student's learning. Mastery learning is at the heart of PowerPath.

Powerpath will auto-assign XP as part of a Powerpath-100 | Quiz | TestOut | Placement lesson or quiz completion.

Create External Test Out
Creates or updates a test-out lesson in a course. This allows integrating with external platforms (such as Edulastic) for content delivery. The created lesson is placed within a Component, acting as a standalone unit of the course, which can also be customized.
Calling this again can potentially edit the existing test-out lesson of the course, as long as the course already has a test-out lesson. The other data in the payload may help alter the lesson location in the course, and specific internals of it.
POST /powerpath/createExternalTestOut

Create External Placement Test
This request is very similar to Create External Test Out above, but creates or updates instead a placement lesson in a course that integrates with an external platform. This enables automated student onboarding by determining appropriate grade-level course enrollment through third-party assessment tools. 
This request fails if grades, subject or courseIdOnFail are not provided. The following parameters are used for the automated placement progression system:
subject binds the test to placement sequences
grades determines the ordering within the subject progression
courseIdOnFail specifies automatic enrollment when students score below the 90% mastery threshold.
Calling this again can potentially edit the existing placement lesson of the course, as long as the course already has a placement lesson of the same grade. The other data in the payload may help alter the lesson location in the course, and specific internals of it.
POST /powerpath/createExternalPlacementTest

Make External Test Assignment
Utilizes a third-party endpoint, which manages tests on Edulastic, to instantiate the external test for a student. This returns the credentials needed by the student to access Edulastic, along with a link to the test and some identifiers to enable test results retrieval later.
Applicable for external test-out or placement lessons.


POST /powerpath/makeExternalTestAssignment

Get External Test Assignment Results
Utilizes a third-party endpoint, which manages tests on Edulastic, to retrieve test results for an ongoing/completed test on Edulastic, porting the data into the OneRoster structure. It utilizes the identifiers stored in the test results of the student assigned to the test to fetch the data.
Applicable for external test-out or placement lessons.


POST /powerpath/importExternalTestAssignmentResults

Lesson Mastery - Placement
Set of endpoints to control the Placement logic for getting a student properly enrolled in a subject’s course(s) lesson(s).
These will work over lessons with lessonType = “placement” available in the ComponentResource’s metadata.
The Resource’s metadata must also contain a subject and target grades to determine the serving order for a subject.
These placement test lessons behave the same as quiz or test-out lessons in a sense that you can seamlessly use the getAssessmentProgress, updateStudentQuestionResponse and finalStudentAssessmentResponse endpoints to retrieve information about or complete them.
Get Subject Progress
Provides an overview about available courses of a Subject, and if (or how far) the student has progressed in each.
Each active course found contains:
A reference to the course, including: courseCode, dateLastModified, grades, level, orgSourcedId, sourcedId, status, subjects, and title
An isEnrolled boolean indicating if the student is enrolled in the course
A hasUsedTestOut boolean indicating if the student has finalized results for the End of Course Test of the course (false in case the course has no test-out lesson available)
A testOutLessonId referencing the available test-out lesson in the course (null if not found)
Counters for completedLessons and totalLessons.
Completed lessons are the ones with at least one fully graded assessment result associated
Tallies for totalAttainableXp and totalXpEarned
“Attainable XP” is the sum of all base XP values in test resources in a course/unit, ignoring potential accuracy multipliers
The total XP earned comes from the assessment result of a lesson with the most XP earned across all attempts in it, considering the multipliers for accuracy. Notice this may be greater than the attainable XP above.
Returns an error if the student is not found, no subject is provided, or no courses are found with that subject in its subjects property.
GET /powerpath/placement/getSubjectProgress

Get Next Placement Test
Provides a reference for the next available placement test a student can take for the onboarding process in a subject, along with the test’s grade level.
Will return a null reference if the student has completed all placement test available, or the last placement test taken received a score less than 90/100 (indicating they should be enrolled in that grade’s courses)
Also returns the onboarded flag as true if there’s no next test available to take.
If the student has completed all placement tests available for a subject, a exhaustedTests flag is also set to true.
Returns an error if the student is not found, no subject is provided, or no placement tests are found for the provided subject.
GET /powerpath/placement/getNextPlacementTest

Get Current Level
Informs the grade a student is considered to be in based on completed placement tests it has. Starts at the grade level of the first test available, and ranges all the way through the last test’s grade.
Also returns the onboarded flag as true if there’s no next test available to take.
Returns an error if the student is not found, no subject is provided, or no placement tests are found for the provided subject.
GET /powerpath/placement/getCurrentLevel

Get All Placement Tests
Returns a list of all available placement tests a subject has, ordered by the first available grade in grades, and potentially including assessment results if the student has finalized any.
For each test found, the ComponentResource, Resource (w/ metadata), Assessment Line Item (if available) and Assessment Results (if available and for all attempts) objects are provided.
GET /powerpath/placement/getAllPlacementTests

PowerPath 100
PowerPath 100 Structure
See Creating Content guide
The PowerPath 100 endpoints expect a ComponentResource + Resource pointing to a QTI Assessment Test or external test taking tool. For using the test as a dynamic quiz (questions served one after the other until racing max score), the ComponentResource metadata of the lesson must include a lessonType = “powerpath-100”. Here's an example of a QTI Assessment Test in the QTI API: https://staging.alpha-1edtech.com/powerpath/syllabus/c3f22bb2-e527-4e52-8b5c-289ef2bd1a16 
The QTI Assessment Test must include multiple questions. The PowerPath getNextQuestion endpoint will select a question from the Test, considering variables like current student PP score and question difficulty, so the set of questions one student sees might not be the same as another student sees.
Example of course: https://staging.alpha-1edtech.com/powerpath/syllabus/c3f22bb2-e527-4e52-8b5c-289ef2bd1a16 . This course includes 6 units, each unit having an Article (using QTI stimulus) and a PP100 quiz (using QTI Assessment Test).
PowerPath 100 Results Structure
See Grades and Progress
By using PowerPath's updateStudentQuestionResponse endpoint, the result objects will be automatically created and managed. But here's how it's structured:

The PowerPath 100 lesson has an associated AssessmentLineItem that represents the lesson as a whole. Each individual question inside the lesson also has its own AssessmentLineItem, each having as a parent the AssessmentLineItem that represents the lesson. So for a PP100 lesson containing 100 questions, there will be 101 AssessmentLineItems.
Each student's response to a question will create an AssessmentResult object, referencing the AssessmentLineItem that represents the question, containing the score 0 or 1 (correct/incorrect). Also, an AssessmentResult representing the whole lesson (referencing the lesson’s AssessmentLineItem) will be updated with the new student score (0 to 100).
These objects don't need to be updated manually, though. The endpoints updateStudentQuestionResponse manages this automatically and getAssessmentProgress returns the historical progress and past responses.
PowerPath 100 algorithm
The PowerPath 100 algorithm uses the same model as IXL. By reverse engineering it, we discovered some rules for incrementing and decrementing the scores they use as well as some other information about how the base calculation changes depending on the exercise being worked on.

The targets for the expected number of questions a student should see during a quiz to attain 100 score while varying their accuracy:
A student with 100% accuracy (never misses a question) should see 11 questions
A student with 80% accuracy (correct 4/5 times) should see ~18 questions
A student with 90% should ideally see ~14 questions to preserve a nice balance and progression
IXL’s Algorithm Reverse Engineering
What was extracted from IXL is that exercises grant scores in a similar fashion across exercises and grade levels, with some tweaks to the initial parameters:
Most of the exercises tested across all grades followed this calculation for increments. We can call this IXL Regular:
increment = Max(2,10-Floor(score/10))
score is the score the student had before answering the question
These usually takes 24 questions to complete
On some occasions (not seemingly tied to grade levels or how fast you answer questions), it seems to grant an additional point for correct answers when above 70 score. It also raises the min-score granted to 3 points. We call this IXL Advanced:
increment = Max(3,10-Floor(score/10) + 1*(score >= 70))
where 1*(score >= 70) calculates to either 0 or 1 depending on the score
These take around 20 questions to complete
Also, it seems some exercises follow a much faster rate, giving a higher base score (15), higher min score (4), and works in tiers. We can call this IXL Fast: 
increment = IF(score>=80, 4, IF(score>=70, 5, IF(score>=60, 6, IF(score>=50, 7, IF(score>=40, 8, IF(score>=30, 9, IF(score>=20, 11, IF(score>=10, 13, 15))))))))
These take around 14 questions to complete

With that said, it could be possible that some exercises receive different formulas depending on various criteria. The most likely is the exercise difficulty:
For example, going into a skill on IXL that has a low mastery score on average could be a good candidate for an exercise that grants more points to students, maybe after X many students have completed it
Or maybe these scores can fluctuate depending on the exercise grade level, or perhaps include some streak bonuses for kids when they get 10 answers right in a row (potentially granting an extra point per question), etc…

As for deducting points for getting answers wrong, all IXL scoring models seems to work in tiers, as described below:

New PP100 Scoring Algorithm Proposal
Going back to the original goals stated above, we were able to simulate tens of thousands of students with different accuracies going through the exercises granting different scores per questions, to see on average how many questions they needed to attain 100 score:
The formula that best contained the values was:
increment = Max(4,14-Floor(score/10))
decrement =
If score >= 90 ? -8
if score >= 80 ? -7
If score >= 70 ? -6
If score >= 50 ? -5
If score >= 40 ? -4
If score >= 30 ? -3
If score >= 20 ? -2
If score >= 0 ? -1
Which was able to get:
11 questions for 100% accuracy
~14 questions for 90% accuracy
~18 questions for 80% accuracy
And ~24 questions for 70% and ~35 questions for 60% as well
This is the average number of questions a student needs to go through, having X% accuracy in order to reach 100 score:
Student Accuracy %

Average progression of scores for students grouped by accuracy level. Simulating 10,000 runs per accuracy
Also, for some documentation obtained here, we checked a different approach for serving questions and changing scores:

Decrements (OLD)
Decrements (PROPOSED)

Which ensures a smoother curve for granting and removing points per difficulty level, creating a more intuitive reward system for students, while also preserving the “high-stakes” approach IXL and previous algorithms have, granting more at the start, and removing more at the end.
Below there’s a comparison of how different IXL and PP100 scores fluctuate depending on where the students are, and if they got a question right or wrong. X axis is the current score. If O means correct answers, and If X means incorrect answers. 




New PP100 Question Difficulty Algorithm Proposal
As for the decision-making around the difficulty of the question to serve next, here’s how IXL does it:
Whenever crossing the thresholds for 70, 80, and 90 points, the UI displays some medals to engage students more with the tool
Additionally, when crossing the 90+ threshold, a special message appears to the user to “get ready for tougher questions” (entering their ‘Challenge Zone’)
IXL categorizes questions in easy, medium and hard, and they are distributed in the exercise as:
0-70: easy questions
71-90: medium + hard questions
91-100: hard questions
It’s not clear if in the 71-90 bracket there’s a specific algorithm for distributing the questions differently. This could potentially underuse medium questions in the long run.
Ultimately, there’s no information on the data from the question presented on screen about its difficulty. All information we know about how hard it is is by A) comparing it with other exercises at the beginning of the set and B) a PDF available in IXL that specifies this is the rule they use for difficulty
Proposed Algorithm:
Preserve the “medals” or “achievements” when crossing the 70, 80, and 90 score thresholds
Adjust difficulty ranges to be:
0-49: Easy questions
50-89: Medium + Hard questions
Selected randomly with 75% chance of being Medium, and 25% chance of being Hard, to ensure a more even distribution of questions for different accuracies.
90-99: Hard questions only
Priorities for question serving:
Prioritises unanswered questions from the bank first (any difficulty, to be filtered by it later)
Prioritises questions of the right difficulty bracket
The algorithm will try first serving a question from the bank that matches the difficulty of the brackets above. If not found, expands the search to find any other questions for remaining difficulties
For example: If the score is 30 and the student has exhausted “easy” questions, we randomly serve a “medium” question, or a “hard” if “medium” is also exhausted.
Requested “easy” -> fallback to “medium” then “hard”
Requested “medium” -> fallback to “hard” then “easy”
Requested “hard” -> fallback to “medium” then “easy”
Prioritizes human-approved questions
This is a new flag for QTI questions that lives in its metadata. Available questions are separated in two buckets
If no approved question in available, then pick non-approved ones
Finally randomizes a question from the remaining pool
The idea is to prioritize avoiding question repetition in favor of difficulty matching, assuming exposing the student to a new question is more valuable than satisfying their current knowledge level in terms of difficulty to serve.
Powerpath Quiz
Quizzes are structured very similarly to PowerPath 100 lessons, with the difference that the ComponentResource’s metadata.lessonType is ”quiz”. See the PowerPath 100 lesson specification above for more details.
In this lesson mode, all test questions are supposed to be served to the student in the same order as the QTI test defines them, all readily available (meaning the getNextQuestion endpoint is unnecessary), and its response feedback is withheld until the lesson is finalized.
Question responses are still submitted with updateStudentQuestionResponse, while finishing a test must be made using finalStudentAssessmentResponse.
After a test is finished, information about the attempt results will be available using the getAssessmentProgress endpoint, including accuracy and xp metadata.
Powerpath Test Out
Test Out lessons are structured very similarly to PowerPath 100 and Quiz lessons, with the difference that the ComponentResource’s metadata.lessonType is ”test-out”. See the PowerPath 100 and PowerPath Quiz lesson specifications above for more details.
In terms of behavior, a Test Out lesson behaves exactly the same as a Quiz. Its purpose changes, however, in the sense that a course is supposed to have a single TestOut lesson available in it, ideally as the last activity of the course, which should contain an amalgamation of questions covering the entirety (or most) of the course’s skills.
For courses that contain a test-out lesson available, the testOut endpoint will serve the TestOut reference, so the student can take the test, and if there’s an attempt finalized for it, also serves the assessment result including score, accuracy, and xp metadata.
A TestOut lesson is also important in terms of Dynamic Course Progression (WIP) so that students can take the test if they feel ready to progress to the next level. Failing to attain a minimum score of 90/100 in the test will trigger other algorithms like Hole-Filling and Scaffolding to serve additional/supplementary material the student must complete before moving on to the text course/level.
Powerpath Placement
Placement lessons are structured very similarly to PowerPath 100 and Quiz lessons, with the difference that:
The ComponentResource’s metadata.lessonType is ”placement” 
It’s bound to a subject, using the Resource’s metadata.subject attribute
It’s also bound to a grade level, using the Resource’s metadata.grades (caveat that grades is an array, and Placement tests will only work with its first available grade)
The Resource’s metadata.courseIdOnFail attribute, for the auto course enrollment on test fail, should be of a valid course
See the PowerPath 100 and PowerPath Quiz lesson specifications above for more details. Also see the API specification here.
In terms of behavior, a Placement test behaves exactly the same as a Quiz. Its purpose changes, however, in the sense that placement tests are used for the student’s onboarding process in a subject, allowing the system/manager to properly enroll the student in the correct level, which matches their current skill level and abilities.
Placement tests are currently bound to a non-enrollable course (ideally) of a subject, and are offered in order for students to assess their knowledge.
Assessing the current student’s grade level can be done using getCurrentLevel, which ranges across the grades of the available placement tests of the subject.
For example, a subject that contains placement tests for grades K-12, will have the student starting at grade K, and having them moving up the ladder provided they score a minimum of 90/100 in each test.
Failing to attain such a score considers the user as onboarded in that “failed” placement test’s grade level.
While onboarding a student, the getNextPlacementTest endpoint can be used to get a reference for the next placement test in the list the student must take/complete to decide if they move on to the next grade. If the student is considered onboarded in the subject (see rule above), or the student has exhausted available placement tests for a subject (attaining a score of 90+/100 in each), no placement test reference is returned
Additionally, using the getAllPlacementTests endpoint provides you with a comprehensive list of placement tests available for a subject, including attempt data for student’s results in each test.
Upon failure in a placement test (i.e.: scoring <90%), the student gets automatically enrolled in the corresponding subject course of that grade. This is defined by creating a placement test with a courseidOnFail  attribute in the test Resource, which’s the sourcedId of the course to enroll the student in.
It’s also convenient to assume that when creating placement tests for a subject, we will have a single Course holding all these tests, marked for a particular subject, and that ideally can’t have students enrolled into it, that we can pull the tests from when offering the onboarding experience. Each of these tests would then point to other courses for the auto-enrollment.
WIP - There will be changes to the logic above related to screener tests, and being able to start the placement progress in an arbitrary position of the sequence. Will be described here in more detail once implemented.
External Tests
External tests enable integration between OneRoster and third-party testing platforms (currently only Edulastic), allowing students to take assessments on external platforms while maintaining PowerPath's authentication, tracking, analytics and result synchronization.

External tests support both test-out and placement lesson types, sharing common integration patterns and endpoints while preserving their respective educational purposes and behaviors.

Creating test-outs and placements can be achieved using the following approaches:


Manual Creation: Create a lesson with the appropriate
lessonType = "test-out" | "placement" in the ComponentResource, set the vendorId to the enrollment ID from the test inventory spreadsheet, and add toolProvider = "edulastic" to the Resource metadata.
Automated Creation: Use the dedicated creation endpoints (createExternalTestOut or createExternalPlacementTest) which handle the complete setup process including Component configuration and external platform integration (see details above).
On OneRoster, the results fetched on the external tools are stored under a single 
External Test Outs
The external Test Out system connects OneRoster courses with third-party assessment platforms to enable students to demonstrate course proficiency and skip content they have already mastered. These end-of-course assessments contain questions covering the entirety of course skills, allowing students to prove mastery without completing intermediate lessons.


Once the test is created for the course (see details above), the testOut endpoint can be used to find its reference, and using its ID, the assignment of the test for the student on Edulastic can be done using the makeExternalTestAssignment endpoint. A test assignment means a new instance of the test is created for that student on Edulastic, and they can take the test there.
In order to retrieve test results, the getExternalTestAssignmentResults endpoint can be used. This will grab whatever data is currently available for this test on the external tool (either ongoing or completed tests, including test summary and individual question results), and store this in the OneRoster structure using AssessmentLineItems and AssessmentResults for each question and the test as a whole. 
Since Edulastic does not offer WebHooks or WebSockets for fetching test results on understanding when it’s submitted for review, it’s advised to introduce a way to periodically or manually fire this request to get the data you need. For example, wrapping the endpoint call with a tool capable of polling (like react-query)
Keep in mind that the endpoints testOut, makeExternalTestAssignment, and getExternalTestAssignmentResults endpoints are capable of returning the external test access credentials, if it’s an external test.
Related to the individual question results, Edulastic supports partial scores on them. Questions are often ranging between 0-1 scores, but can have a float in between depending on the interaction type. If that happens, Edulastic returns the question as correct the same way. However, the final test score considers the sum of individual question scores, divided by the number of questions. This value is what we store in the test result on OneRoster as both the final test score and the accuracy of the student (for XP calculation).
For testing, consider trying out the following courses on Staging to see the full integration on Timeback:
Reading Grade 3 (course’s sourced_id: 912c3e4c-ddb6-4f54-8816-d34b0043e67c)
Language G3 (v8) (course’s scourced_id: a40bf161-de6e-40e6-a584-08b54c48cd21)
External Placement Tests
External Placement Tests enable automated student onboarding by determining appropriate grade-level course enrollment through third-party assessment platforms. Those tests maintain all standard placement behaviors including subject binding, grade progression tracking, and automatic enrollment via the courseIdOnFail attribute, while leveraging external platform assessment content and capabilities. It follows the same as test-out creation but differs on attributes that are Placement-Specific.
Requirements:
subject - Required for placement progression logic and subject binding
grades - Array specifying grade levels (only first grade used for logic)
courseIdOnFail - Course ID for automatic enrollment when student scores less than 90%
Once created, external placement tests utilize the standard workflow: retrieve test references through placement endpoints, assign tests to students via makeExternalTestAssignment, and synchronize results using getExternalTestAssignmentResults. The placement progression logic remains intact, allowing students who score ≥ 90% to advance to the next test via getNextPlacementTest, while those scoring below this threshold are automatically enrolled in their appropriate grade-level course, maintaining full integration with PowerPath's placement progression system.
For testing, consider trying out the following courses on Staging to see the full integration on Timeback:
Language subject - Course “Language Grade 3”
courseIdOnFail: 0238712c-0178-45b2-a764-fa7fa0250ded
Reading subject - Course “Reading Grade 3”
courseIdOnFail: 912c3e4c-ddb6-4f54-8816-d34b0043e67c
Assessment Banks
Assessment Banks serve as an architectural enhancement that provides an additional layer on top of existing ComponentResource’s lesson types (test-out, placement, quiz), enabling a single lesson to contain multiple associated tests.
Rather than having students retake identical tests multiple times, Assessment Banks allow different test variations to be served for each attempt - whether through internal QTI assessments or external tests from platforms like Edulastic.
This approach maintains educational integrity by preventing test memorization while preserving the familiar PowerPath lesson interface, with the system automatically selecting appropriate test versions based on attempt history and availability.
The diagram below lays out how resources should be configured in order for PowerPath to interpret it as an assessment-bank, and be able to provide tests in sequence:

On the top part, we have the base structure for now regular external tests work in the platform:
Single Resource being referenced by a ComponentResource (lesson)
Resource contains information about the toolProvider (where the tests is to be taken), vendorId (indicating the ID of the test in the external platform), and has a type of “interactive” so UIs built on top of it can know how to handle these resources
A single line item is built for the lesson, and shared across all students taking the test
Individual sub-line-items are built for each of the tests’ questions, provided the external tool serves granular information about individual questions
Multiple AssessmentResult object for each student attempt in that lesson
Also individual results for individual questions, bound to the questions’ line items above
The bottom diagram is the assessment banks of external tests:
A “parent” Resource describing the Assessment-bank structure (sub-resources available to be served in order, toolProvider to describe how to integrate with 3rd party tools, etc…). It also uses a specific assessment-bank as its type
A series of “sub”-Resources each detailing how the test works on the external platform. These are identical to the external test resources from the non-assessment-bank approach above.
For example, on Edulastic these Resources would define the vendorId, to be used to determine the test to assign a student. For MasteryTrack, it relies on the grade and subject of the Resource to determine a fresh test to serve.
A single line item built for the lesson with a metadata.isAssessmentBank = true to indicate it belongs to an assessment-bank type of resource, and a Result object that contains the assessment bank state of the student in the lesson.
The state contains information about the current test attempt, the sub-Resource ID to be used as the test to serve for that attempt, and the historic data for previous test attempts and Resources used for each.
For each sub-Resource, an individual sub-line item is created, pointing to the lesson line item, to represent the test itself on the 3rd party platform.
The only difference in the data is that these line items contain a metadata.testResourceId equals to the Resource ID used from the bank for that test. It’s the info needed to find where to properly write test results later on.
From this point on, the structure is the same as the non-assessment-bank lessons detailed above.
What’s important for the construction of an assessment bank is:
To have a series of individual test resources that point to the test-taking platform (each tool requiring specific data)
A parent Resource object as assessment-bank type that includes an array of Resources pointing to each of the “sub” tests
And from that point, the powerpath endpoints will work seamlessly to provide the experience. Worth noting that you can use the createNewAttempt and resetAttempt endpoints on the lesson to be able to navigate or retry the resources series.
PowerPath handles the individual sub-Resources in round-robin fashion, meaning it starts with the first Resource in the list always, and for each new attempt created, it’ll cycle through the ones available (that are still functional) and serve that next.
All PowerPath endpoints details above are fully integrated with Assessment Banks, except for the external test creation endpoints. The reason is that they don’t handle the sub Resources well, so it was skipped. But it could work if you create the Sub-Resources beforehand, and pass as metadata to the request the resources array containing their sourcedIds, then make the update to the parent resource to transform it into an assessment-bank type.

Rendering QTI
We have a web page that render QTI Items which URL can be used to embed QTI Content in any HTML page.

The URL has the format: https://alpha-powerpath-ui-production.up.railway.app/qti-embed/[identifier]

Example: https://alpha-powerpath-ui-production.up.railway.app/qti-embed/noun-identification-item-mom 

This can be embedded in any webpage using an iframe like so

<iframe src="https://alpha-powerpath-ui-production.up.railway.app/qti-embed/noun-identification-item-mom" />


An event is emitted every time user changes the response and can be captured like so


<script>
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.data.type === 'QTI_RESPONSE_CHANGE') {
    // Handle the QTI response data
    const { responseIdentifier, response } = event.data;
    
    // Process the data as needed
    console.log({ responseIdentifier, response })
  }
});
</script>

Lesson Plans (Deprecated)

The imperative Lesson plan endpoints are deprecated in favor of the operation log mechanism
The endpoints described here still work but may be removed in a future release

What are Lesson Plans?

Lesson plans enable tracking of a student's unique progress through a course. 
They provide a personalized learning path that can be customized for individual students while maintaining the structure and content of the original course.

Rationale

Lesson plans originate from course components and component resources:
Course Components represent the structural elements of a course (units, lessons, modules)
Component Resources are the actual learning materials (videos, documents, quizzes, etc.) associated with those components
When a lesson plan is created, it automatically generates a tree structure based on the course's components and resources
⚠️ Note

Any changes to the underlying Course will not affect any existing Lesson Plans.

Refer to the Sample Use Cases section for more information on updating a Course.


Personalized Learning Paths:
Each student can have their own unique lesson plan for a course
Lesson plans can be manually modified through our API endpoints
Items can be skipped, reordered, or reparented to create custom learning sequences
The system maintains the relationship between the original course structure and the personalized plan
Tree Structure:
Lesson plans are represented as a hierarchical tree structure in the database
Components can contain sub-components and resources
Resources are always children of components
Data Structure
Entities

The lesson plan system consists of two main entities: Lesson Plan and Lesson Plan Items


💡 Key concept


A Lesson Plan is the collection of Lesson Plan Items for a student’s lesson plan in a course.


Lesson Plan Fields Glossary:
ID: Unique identifier for the lesson plan
Class ID: Reference to the class the student is enrolled in
Course ID: Reference to the course
User ID: Reference to the student
Lesson Plan Item Fields Glossary:
ID: Unique identifier for the lesson plan item
Lesson Plan ID: Reference to the parent lesson plan
Type: Either "component" or "resource"
Component ID: Reference to a course component (for type "component")
Component Resource ID: Reference to a component resource (for type "resource")
Order: Display order within the parent
Parent ID: Reference to another lesson plan item (creates the tree structure)
Skipped: Whether this item is skipped for the student. 
More details in the Sample Use Cases section.
Rules and Lesson Plan Tree Assembly
Each student can only have a lesson plan per course and class.
Lesson Plan Items are organized in a tree-like structure using the parent ID field.
A Lesson Plan Item with no parent ID or that references itself as a parent is considered to belong to the root level of the tree.
Lesson Plan Items marked as skipped will be added to the Lesson Plan Tree but will not be returned in the Lesson Plan Tree endpoint. 
This field can be used to hide a particular resource or lesson from the user, but it will always be present in the underlying structure and the database.
A Lesson Plan Item can only be of type component or resource, which must be linked to a course component or a component resource, respectively.

Customizing a Lesson Plan through manual updates 

The lesson plan system provides several endpoints for manually updating a student's lesson plan. These endpoints allow for fine-grained control over the learning path.

Creating a Lesson Plan

Endpoint: POST /powerpath/lessonPlans

Description: Creates a new lesson plan for a student in a course. 

Request Body:
{
  "courseId": "course-123",
  "userId": "student-456",
  "classId": "class-789" // Optional
}


⚠️ Note
The Class Sourced ID is optional. If not provided, we will try to assert the default class for that course



Responses:
200 - Lesson Plan exists and its ID is returned
201 - Lesson Plan is created and its ID is returned
404 - Lesson Plan doesn’t exist

Attaching Components

Endpoint: POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/component

Description: Creates a lesson plan item of type "component" and attaches it to the lesson plan. The component must reference a valid course component.

Request Body:
{
  "componentId": "component-123",
  "order": 1,
  "parentId": "parent-item-456", // Optional
  "skipped": false // Optional
}

Rules:
The component ID must reference an existing course component
If parent ID is provided, the parent must be of type "component"
If no parent ID is provided the component will be added to the root level
Attaching Resources

Endpoint: POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/resource

Description: Creates a lesson plan item of type "resource" and attaches it to the lesson plan. The resource must reference a valid component resource.

Request Body:
{
  "componentResourceId": "resource-123",
  "order": 1,
  "parentId": "parent-component-456", // Required
  "skipped": false // Optional
}

Rules:
The Component Resource ID must reference an existing component resource
Parent ID is required and must reference a lesson plan item of type "component"
Resources cannot have other resources as children
Updating Lesson Plan Items

Endpoint: PATCH /powerpath/lessonPlans/items/{lessonPlanItemId}

Description: Updates an existing lesson plan item. The main use case is re-parenting items to change the tree structure.

Request Body:
{
  "parentId": "new-parent-123",
  "order": 2,
  "skipped": true
}


⚠️ Note

This is a PATCH endpoint, so it is not required to submit the full Lesson Plan Item


Deleting Lesson Plan Items

Endpoint: DELETE /powerpath/lessonPlans/items/{lessonPlanItemId}

Description: Deletes a lesson plan item and all its children.

Response: 204 No Content on success

🔥 DANGER


This operation is irreversible.


Deleting Lesson Plans

Endpoint: DELETE /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}

Description: Deletes a lesson plan

Response: 204 No Content on success

🔥 DANGER


This operation is irreversible.



Retrieving a Lesson Plan Tree

Endpoint: GET /powerpath/lessonPlans/{courseId}/{userId}

Description: Returns the complete lesson plan tree for a student in a course.

Response: Returns a nested structure showing the complete tree with components and resources.Example: Customizing a Student's Learning Path



Sample Use Cases

Updating a Course

When a Course is updated (through its courseComponents and componentResources), the already existing Lesson Plans will not be updated.

To perform an update in a Course you must:
Create the appropriate component and component resources


For each existing Lesson Plan, add the proper Lesson Plan Item referencing the created component and component resources
Skipping Items

Any lesson plan item can be marked as skipped by setting the appropriate field to true.
Skipped items will not be returned in the student’s Lesson Plan Tree.

This can be used to remove lessons that a student has mastered, or to set up support material for the course which can then be manually toggled when a student requires it.

Adding Support Material

When structuring a course with the courseComponents and componentResources endpoints, you can tag resources with the following metadata:

{ "metadata": { "lessonRole": "support"}}

⚠️ Note

This is in addition to any other existent metadata


When a Lesson Plan is created, any components tagged with the aforementioned metadata will be marked as skipped by default in the Lesson Plan.

This allows the creation of support resources that will be automatically skipped and can then be manually enabled and is our recommendation when creating support material for a course.

Dynamic Lesson Plans
What are Dynamic Lesson Plans?
Dynamic Lesson Plans are personalized learning paths that enable tracking and customization of a student's unique progress through a course. They provide individualized learning experiences while maintaining the structure and content of the original course.
Unlike traditional static lesson plans, the new lesson plans api uses a command log approach to track and apply personalization changes, ensuring that lesson plans can stay synchronized with course updates while preserving student customizations.
Core Concepts
Base Course Structure
Courses serve as the top-level educational containers
Course Components provide structural organization (units, lessons, modules)
Component Resources represent actual learning materials (videos, assessments, documents)
Lesson Plan Generation
When a student enrolls in a course and a lesson plan is created, the system:
Mirrors Course Structure: Creates a personalized lesson plan replicating the entire course hierarchy
Applies Learning Path Logic: Categorizes resources and components using lessonRole metadata:
"essential" resources are visible by default
"support" resources are initially hidden but can be enabled when needed
Operations Log System
The new system replaces direct lesson plan manipulation with a command-based operation log:
All changes are stored as operations in a persistent log
Operations can be replayed to reconstruct lesson plans
Course updates can be synchronized while preserving personalizations
Full audit trail of all modifications
Before we start
When creating operations, the components and resources (component resources) should be referenced by their sourced ids in the original course, item ids in lesson plans are not stable and can change during recreations
Available Operations
The system provides the following operation types for lesson plan customization:
1. set-skipped - Show/Hide Content
Controls visibility of lesson plan items for students.
Payload:
{
  "type": "set-skipped",
  "payload": {
    "target": {
      "type": "component|resource",
      "id": "target-item-id"
    },
    "value": true|false
  }
}


Use Cases:
Show support materials when needed
Temporarily disable problematic content
Any other case where the visibility of an item needs to be changed
2. move-item-before - Reorder Content (Before)
Moves an item to be positioned before another item within the same parent.
Payload:
{
  "type": "move-item-before",
  "payload": {
    "target": { "type": "component|resource", "id": "item-to-move-id" },
    "reference_id": "reference-item-id"
  }
}


3. move-item-after - Reorder Content (After)
Moves an item to be positioned after another item within the same parent.
Payload:
{
  "type": "move-item-after",
  "payload": {
    "target": { "type": "component|resource", "id": "item-to-move-id" },
    "reference_id": "reference-item-id"
  }
}


4. move-item-to-start - Move to Beginning
Moves an item to the beginning of its parent container.

What it does:
Finds all lesson plans associated with the course
Recreates each lesson plan from the base course structure
Applies all historical operations to maintain personalizations
Returns list of affected lesson plan IDs
Note:
This may be a time-consuming operation depending on the amount of lesson plans that exists for a given course, in the future we may introduce update locks, background processing strategies and other mechanisms to prevent deadlocks (e.g two processes rebuilding all lesson plans at the same time)
Synchronization Strategies
The operations system provides two synchronization approaches:
1. Incremental Sync (Recommended)
Endpoint: POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations/sync
Efficient: Only applies new operations since the last sync
Fast: Minimal processing time for real-time updates
Safe: Preserves existing structure while applying changes
Use Case: Regular updates and most operation applications
2. Full Recreation (Recovery)
Endpoint: POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/recreate
Complete: Drops all items and rebuilds from scratch
Thorough: Ensures complete consistency with base course
Intensive: More processing time but guarantees clean state
Use Case: Major updates, corruption recovery, debugging
Workflow Examples
Example 1: Hide a Struggling Student's Advanced Content
1. Store the operation
POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations
{
  "operation": {
    "type": "set-skipped",
    "payload": {
      "target": {
        "type": "component",
        "id": "advanced-unit-id"
      },
      "value": true
    }
  },
  "reason": "Student struggling with prerequisites"
}



2. Apply the changes
POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations/sync
Example 2: Reorder Lessons Based on Student Performance
Move a remediation lesson to the beginning

POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations
{
  "operation": {
    "type": "move-item-to-start",
    "payload": {
      "target": {
        "type": "component",
        "id": "remediation-lesson-id"
      }
    }
  },
  "reason": "Student needs remediation before continuing"
}



Apply the reordering
POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations/sync
Example 3: Add Supplementary Resources
Add extra practice material
POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations
{
  "operation": {
    "type": "add-custom-resource",
    "payload": {
      "resource_id": "extra-practice-resource-id",
      "parent_component_id": "target-lesson-id",
      "skipped": false
    }
  },
  "reason": "Student requested additional practice"
}



Apply the addition
POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations/sync
Migration from previous endpoints
The new operations system replaces the previous imperative endpoints:
Previous Endpoint 
New Approach


POST /{lessonPlanId}/component
Atm it's not possible to add foreign components to lesson plans
POST /{lessonPlanId}/resource
Use add-custom-resource operation
PATCH /items/{itemId}
Use appropriate move operation
DELETE /items/{itemId}
Use set-skipped operation with value: true

Important Notes:
Previous imperative endpoints are deprecated but still functional, any changes made directly to lesson plan items are considered ephemeral and will be lost in the next recreation of the lesson plan
New integrations should use the operations system exclusively
Error Handling
Operations are designed to fail gracefully:
Target Not Found: Operation skipped if referenced items don't exist
Invalid References: Gracefully ignored during replay
Constraint Violations: Detailed error messages returned
Partial Failures: Individual operation failures don't break entire sync
Each operation execution returns a result indicating success or failure with detailed error information for troubleshooting.
Best Practices
1. Always Sync After Storing Operations
Store operation
POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations

Apply changes
POST /powerpath/lessonPlans/{lessonPlanId}/operations/sync
2. Use Descriptive Reasons
{
  "operation": {
    /* ... */
  },
  "reason": "Student failed prerequisite assessment - providing remediation"
}


3. Batch Related Operations
Store multiple related operations before syncing.
4. Monitor Operation Results
Check sync responses for operation failures and handle appropriately.
5. Use Incremental Sync for Regular Updates
Reserve full recreation for major changes or debugging scenarios.
Limitations and Considerations
Resource Dependencies: Added resources must exist and be active
Parent Constraints: Resources can only be children of components
Same Parent Moves: Relative move operations require items to share the same parent
Circular References: System prevents creating circular parent-child component relationships
Operation Order: Operations are applied in sequence - order matters for complex changes

FRQ (Free Response Question) Grader Integration
Overview

This guide explains how to create QTI 3.0 assessment items of type extended text that are compatible with the FRQ automated grading system. To make an extended text item ready to be processed by the FRQ Grader a qti-response-processing block should be added, along with a qti-custom-operator. The same way as defined for the QTI Custom Graders approach:


...
  
<qti-response-processing>
  <qti-set-outcome-value identifier="SCORE">
    <qti-custom-operator class="com.alpha-1edtech.FRQGraderScore />
  </qti-set-outcome-value>
</qti-response-processing>

...

Every QTI item that has on its shape the previously defined block will be processed by the FRQ Grader.

The grader extracts rubric information and question statements from QTI XML files to generate prompts for AI-based scoring. The score will be calculated for each rubric block in a range from 0 to 100. A points system can be provided to the grader that will convert it to the range, see examples below.

The grader will provide a score for each evaluated rubric block along with the averaged score for the entire question response.
Mocked course on Staging environment

An example course was created on staging to showcase this functionality, under the identifier qti-frq-grade-1. Its details can easily be found by calling the endpoint GET /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/qti-frq-grade-1.

Below we have an example of the extended-text resource present on this course, which allows a free response and trigger the FRQ Grader integration, making the answer be analyzed by an LLM following the rubrics defined on the resource:

PowerPath integration with FRQ Grader

The integration happens when a user response is updated for a given question through the endpoint:


PUT /powerpath/updateStudentQuestionResponse

{
  "student": "cbacbb9a-6cac-45f6-85da-18dcce779517",
  "question": "1032805",
  "lesson": "course_1792_unit_U01_topic_T01-Review_resource_course_1792_unit_U01_topic_T01-Review_resource_145407",
  "response": "For (a) we have three isotopes. For (b), to calculate the average we sum the amount of percentage of each items and divide by the total count 3."
}

The call for this endpoint invokes the QTI API /process-response endpoint which will verify if the item type is extended-text and invoke the FRQ Grader endpoint. 
Basic QTI 3.0 Structure Requirements

All QTI assessment items must use the QTI 3.0 namespace and follow the standard structure:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<qti-assessment-item
    xmlns="http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imsqtiasi_v3p0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    </qti-response-processing>


</qti-assessment-item>


Item Body Structure

The <qti-item-body> contains all the content that will be presented to students. The grader extracts question statements from this section, excluding rubric blocks.

Question Content Elements

<qti-item-body>
    <div>
        <h2>Question Title</h2>
        <p>Main question text goes here...</p>
        <p>Additional instructions or context...</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rubric blocks (critical for grading) -->
    <qti-rubric-block>
        <qti-content-body>
            Scoring criteria goes here as plain text...
        </qti-content-body>
    </qti-rubric-block>
</qti-item-body>

Rubric Block Structure

Critical: The automated grader relies on <qti-rubric-block> elements to extract scoring criteria. Each rubric block should contain clear, specific scoring guidelines as plain text within <qti-content-body>.

Basic Rubric Block with Score Indicator

<qti-rubric-block>
    <qti-content-body>
        Score 0.90-1: Demonstrates complete understanding with accurate explanations and examples.
        Score 0.70-0.89: Shows good understanding with minor gaps or unclear explanations.
        Score 0.50-0.69: Partial understanding with significant gaps or misconceptions.
        Score 0-0.49: Little to no understanding demonstrated.
    </qti-content-body>
</qti-rubric-block>

Multiple Rubric Blocks for Different Criteria

A points system can be indicated to evaluate within a range from 0 to 1 for a score. You can include multiple rubric blocks to assess different aspects:

<qti-rubric-block>
    <qti-content-body>
        Content Knowledge (40 points): Evaluate the accuracy and depth of scientific concepts, theories, and principles demonstrated in the response.
        Excellent (36-40): Comprehensive understanding with accurate details
        Good (28-35): Solid understanding with minor inaccuracies
        Satisfactory (20-27): Basic understanding with some gaps
        Needs Improvement (0-19): Limited or incorrect understanding
    </qti-content-body>
</qti-rubric-block>

<qti-rubric-block>
    <qti-content-body>
        Communication and Organization (30 points): Assess clarity, logical organization, and appropriate use of scientific terminology.
        Excellent (27-30): Clear, well-organized with proper terminology
        Good (21-26): Generally clear with good organization
        Satisfactory (15-20): Adequate clarity with some organization issues
        Needs Improvement (0-14): Unclear or poorly organized
    </qti-content-body>
</qti-rubric-block>

<qti-rubric-block>
    <qti-content-body>
        Examples and Applications (30 points): Evaluate the quality and relevance of examples, applications, or evidence provided.
        Excellent (27-30): Relevant, detailed examples that enhance understanding
        Good (21-26): Good examples with minor relevance issues
        Satisfactory (15-20): Basic examples that partially support the response
        Needs Improvement (0-14): Irrelevant or missing examples
    </qti-content-body>
</qti-rubric-block>

Response Declarations

Include proper response declarations to make your QTI items complete:

<qti-response-declaration identifier="RESPONSE" cardinality="single" base-type="string" />

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Problematic Practices

1. Vague Rubric Criteria

   - ❌ "Good response" or "Shows understanding"
   - ✅ "Correctly identifies three mechanisms of heat transfer with accurate examples"

2. Missing Rubric Blocks

   - ❌ No <qti-rubric-block> elements
   - ✅ Clear rubric blocks with specific scoring criteria

3. Complex Rubric Structure

   - ❌ Using complex QTI elements like <qti-p>, <qti-li> within rubrics
   - ✅ Simple plain text within <qti-content-body>
4. Incomplete Structure

   - ❌ Missing response declarations or outcome declarations
   - ✅ Complete QTI item structure with all required elements

5. Mixed Content Organization
   - ❌ Rubric content mixed with question content
   - ✅ Clear separation between question statements and rubric blocks
✅ Recommended Approaches

1. Explicit Scoring Guidelines

   - Include specific point values and performance descriptions
   - Use concrete examples of acceptable responses
   - Define minimum requirements for each score level

2. Structured Question Design

   - Break complex questions into clearly defined parts
   - Use standard HTML formatting elements
   - Provide adequate context and instructions

3. Simple Rubric Format
   - Use plain text descriptions within <qti-content-body>
   - Avoid complex nested QTI elements in rubrics
   - Keep scoring criteria clear and direct

QTI Custom Graders

How to represent a custom grader in QTI


...
  
<qti-response-processing>
  <qti-set-outcome-value identifier="SCORE">
    <qti-custom-operator class="com.alpha-1edtech.ExternalApiScore" definition="https://api.example.com/score" />
  </qti-set-outcome-value>
</qti-response-processing>

...

Explanation:
qti-custom-operator class attribute MUST have the string value “com.alpha-1edtech.ExternalApiScore”
qti-custom-operator definition attribute MUST be set with a public API endpoint URL that will be used to grade the question

Scorer API Input/Output contract

The scorer API will receive the following request:


POST https://api.example.com/score

{
  "itemIdentifier": "external-graded-demo", // the QTI item identifier
  "outcomeIdentifier": "SCORE", // The "identifier" value set at the qti-set-outcome-value tag
  "rawXml": "...", // the raw QTI item XML
  "responses": {
    "RESPONSE": "candidate's raw answer",
    ... // other candidate's responses, if specified (there's usually only one with "RESPONSE" key)
  }
}

The scorer API should return the following response object


{
  "outcomes": {
    "SCORE": 0.75          // float or int, exactly the base-type declared in the QTI item
                           // it MUST match the 'identifier' attribute defined at the qti-set-outcome-value tag
  }
}

Data modeling

Let's consider the following History course example from AlphaLearn and describe how all the content inside it can be modeled using our OneRoster API



The data models used to describe the content from this page are:

Course: “1273 AP World History: Modern”
Components: one component for each unit, referencing the parent course
Component 1: “The Global Tapestry c. 1200 to c. 1450”
Component 2: “Networks of Exchange c. 1200 to c. 1450”
Component 3: …

Navigating inside Unit 1 - “The Global Tapestry c. 1200 to c. 1450”, we see the following page:



The data models used to describe content from this page are:
Nested Sub-Component entities for each lesson inside this unit, each sub-component referring the parent unit “The Global Tapestry c. 1200 to c. 1450”
Component 1: “Organizer - Unit1”
Component 2: “Developments in East Asia from c. 1200 to c. 1450”
… and so on

Navigating to Lesson 2 of Unit 1, “Developments in East Asia from c. 1200 to c. 1450”, we can see that it's composed by 3 different activities: a YouTube video, a textual article and a list of questions:




The data models used to describe content from this page are:
Component-resource for each activity, referencing the parent component “Developments in East Asia from c. 1200 to c. 1450”
Component-resource 1: Reading resource, including the resourceSourcedId and associated metadata
Component-resource 2: Video resource, including the resourceSourcedId to the external content and associated metadata
Component-resource 3: Exercise resource, referencing a QTI API Assessment Test


Here's a diagram showing how the content from the example above can be structured:

How do I retrieve a student's current grade level / enrollments for each subject?

Step
What to do
Why / Pointers
1 — Pull the student’s active enrollments
GET /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/enrollments?filter=userSourcedId='<STUDENT_ID>’
One call returns all live classes for the learner (status='active').
2 — Resolve each enrollment’s Class
loop over the enrollment list and call GET /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/classes/{CLASS_ID}.
You need the Class object to find its course reference and any direct metadata.
3 — Retrieve the underlying Course
For every Class, follow class.course.sourcedId:  GET /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses/{COURSE_ID}
Some platforms keep the authoritative subjects[] and grades[] only on the Course. Pulling it ensures you have complete data, even if the Class omits or overrides fields.
4 — Extract subject and grade
Read the first element of subjects[] and grades[] from the Course (fallback to the Class if missing). Normalise the grade (e.g. "03" → 3).
subjects is the canonical tag; grades gives the grade span served.


How do I retrieve a student's current MAP percentile / results for a given subject?
Model of MAP assessments
AssessmentLineItem  (title: “NWEA MAP Math – Winter 2025”)
        │
        └── AssessmentResult (one per student, score = percentile or rit,
                              metadata.rit = raw RIT if you need both)


More details on Brainlift: https://workflowy.com/#/1f072ef18ad8 


Step
What to do
Why / pointers
1 — Locate the MAP test’s Assessment Line Item (ALI)
Query the Gradebook API for ALIs whose title follows the convention NWEA MAP <Subject> – <Season> <Year>.GET /ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentLineItems?filter=title~’NWEA MAP Math’ Pick the newest record (use dateLastModified, the season/year in the title, or simply sort by dateLastModified:desc and take the first hit).
MAP data are modelled as one ALI per administration (e.g., “NWEA MAP Math – Winter 2025”).
2 — Pull the student’s latest Assessment Result (AR)
With the ALI’s sourcedId and the learner’s studentSourcedId, ask for that student’s results—sorted so the most-recent comes first—and limit to one: GET /ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentResults?filter=assessmentLineItemSourcedId='<ALI_ID>' AND studentSourcedId='<STUDENT_ID>'&sort=scoreDate
The Gradebook endpoints support filtering by student and/or assessmentLineItemSourcedId.
3 — Read the percentile (and optional raw RIT)
In the single AR returned: • score = the stored MAP value (store percentile or RIT—check your implementation). • If you stored both, use metadata.rit for the raw RIT and score for the percentile.
The recommended pattern is score = percentile plus an extra metadata.rit field when you need both numbers.
4 — Handle edge cases
No AR found? Student hasn’t taken that MAP yet—return “no data”.Multiple MAP administrations? Repeat the procedure for each season/year if you need historical growth.





How do I retrieve a student's current highest grade mastered for a given subject?

More details on Brainlift: https://workflowy.com/#/86e4708ec5f5 

Overall: retrieve the highest end of course test the student completed with >=90% accuracy.


Step
What to do
Why / Pointers
1 — Locate the grade-level placement / test-out Assessment Line Items (ALIs)
Query the Gradebook API for ALIs that belong to the subject and carry a grade tag.Typical patterns:• Metadata – each placement lesson must include metadata.subject and the first element of metadata.grades (e.g. "05") to drive progression logic .• Title convention – many partners name the item like “Math STAAR G3.4” (subject + grade) .Example request (Math):GET /ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentLineItems?filter=metadata.subject~'Math'
Produces one ALI per grade-level checkpoint. Keeping the grade in metadata or in the title lets you infer the level later.
2 — Fetch the student’s latest result for each candidate ALI
For every ALI you found, request the learner’s most-recent Assessment Result (AR):GET /ims/oneroster/gradebook/v1p2/assessmentResults?filter=assessmentLineItemSourcedId='<ALI_ID>' AND studentSourcedId='<STUDENT_ID>'&sort=scoreDate
The Gradebook endpoints let you filter simultaneously by ALI and student, then sort so you only look at the newest attempt.
3 — Check mastery (≥ 90 % accuracy)
In the returned AR look at either:• metadata.accuracy (recommended) – e.g. 91.66 , or• score ÷ resultValueMax.If the value is ≥ 90 %, that grade is considered mastered. A score below 90 % means the placement failed and the learner was (or will be) enrolled in the course for that grade .


4 — Determine the highest mastered grade
Collect every grade that met the 90 % rule, sort them numerically, and keep the greatest one. If no AR meets the threshold return “no mastered grade yet”.


5 — Edge cases
Multiple attempts – always use the most-recent AR per ALI.No placement results – the learner hasn’t taken any grade-level test; you may need to assign the first placement.Custom grading scales – if you store mastery in another metadata field (masteredUnits, boolean flags, etc.), swap the condition in Step 3 accordingly.




How do I get student course completion information?


Step
What to do
Why it works / pointers
1 – Identify student + course
Obtain studentSourcedId and courseSourcedId (e.g., from OneRoster enrollments).
These two IDs drive the next call.
2 – Call PowerPath “Get Course Progress”
GET /powerpath/lessonPlans/getCourseProgress/{courseSourcedId}/student/{studentSourcedId}
Returns a real-time snapshot for that learner in that course.
3 – Transform the returned LineItems + Results
The response packs assessmentLineItems and their assessmentResults together. • Mark each lineItem completed / not completed based on whether it has an attached result. • Pull each lesson’s XP from assessmentResult.metadata.xp.
Lets you turn raw results into “done vs not-done” counts and total earned XP.

How do I calculate the total XP/lessons required for a student to progress from their current grade level to a target grade level?
Goal – Sum the base XP (and optionally the lesson-count) of every course above the learner’s current grade and up to the target grade for the same subject.
Base XP is the value saved on each lesson’s Resource.metadata.xp
Assigned XP is saved at AssessmentResult's metadata.xp

How do I calculate the estimated time/number of hours needed for a student to progress from their current state to the target goal?
Use XP, considering that roughly 1 XP = 1 minute of work.
First find the gap between the student’s current XP and the total XP needed to hit the target grade or course, then translate it straight into time by treating 1 XP as 1 minute—so a shortfall of, say, 1 200 XP equals roughly 1 200 minutes (about 20 hours) of additional work.

How do I convert a target MAP percentile (RIT) goal to the corresponding highest grade mastered goal?
Use the “RIT to Highest grade mastered conversion table”.

RIT Scores and Grades - 2hr Learning Placement & Prediction Model - Column D

How do I get the full course sequence and progression for a given subject area (e.g. math, language)?

Step
What to do
Why it gives the whole picture
1 – Find every course in the subject
GET /ims/oneroster/rostering/v1p2/courses?filter=subjects~'<SUBJECT>'&limit=1000 Sort the list by the lowest grade in grades[] so they appear K → 12.
OneRoster returns every Math/Language/etc. course; ordering by grade produces the grade-to-grade sequence.
2 – Pull the syllabus for each course
For every courseSourcedId from Step 1, call:
GET /powerpath/syllabus/{courseSourcedId}
The syllabus response is the nested Units → Lessons → Resources tree, giving the exact internal progression students follow.

Third-Party App Integration

Timeback offers two distinct methods for integrating third-party applications:
"Launch app" Integration: This method simply launches the third-party application via a single link.
"Deep link" Integration: This method allows Timeback to display separate lessons for each deep link within the third-party application.
For both integration types, a Course is mandatory. Additionally, one or more Resources of the "external" type should be used to represent the external application launch.
"Launch App" Integration Details

This integration type is ideal for third-party applications that either lack deep links or manage the student lesson order in an unpredictable or dynamic manner.

For instance, consider the "Science 3-5" example. It includes a single "external" type Resource with the "url" set to https://www.mobymax.com/TX17203. When students click on this external activity, they are redirected to this URL. Timeback does not track the specific activities performed within the external application.



"Deep link" Integration details

For apps that contain deep links to activities, a Course can be created with one Resource for each deep linked activity. So the course sequence of activities can be defined on Timeback itself. The example below shows this for Alpha Read integration. Each article is a separate Resource of type “external” that has the “url” set as a deep link to a specific article on Alpha Read, for example https://alpharead.alpha-1edtech.com/articles?articleId=16883&crsid=article_16883 



Student credentials / sign-in
1EdTech LTI Support: If the third-party application supports 1EdTech LTI, Timeback can implement an LTI Launch flow, allowing students to access the application already logged in.
Timeback SSO (for in-house Alpha School apps): If the third-party application does not support LTI but is an in-house Alpha School development, it can implement Timeback SSO to prevent students from needing to sign in again.
No SSO Support (Manual Sign-in): If neither of the above options applies, students will need to sign in again when launching the third-party application.
Google Sign-in: If the third-party application supports Google sign-in, students can use their existing Google accounts.
Email/Password Sign-in: If the third-party application supports email/password sign-in, students must use the same email address registered with Timeback. Timeback can display a dialog with credentials to the student upon launching the app, like the example below. Please contact the Timeback team to enable proper storage of email and password lists for this feature.
