# Project structure

This project has 2 git directories:
1. The root directory which has the frontend code and git
2. The /backend directory which has the backend code and git

All scripts are stored in /backend/script. All docs are stored in /docs.

# Planning

When planning, make sure to think hard and understand the user's expectations. Ask any clarifying questions necessary, user is happy to answer. And when writing your plan, make sure to be succint but detailed. Make sure your plan is solid and unambiguous- it should not contain words like may, might or optionally.

# Reviewing changes

When asked to review code changes, get git diffs for both frontend and backend directories. Read all the changes made across all files. Then evaluate if:
- The changes align with the given objective
- There are any bugs or issues with the code changes
- The code changes negatively affect any functionality unrelated to the objective
Report back with your findings on each of the above. After the user is satisfied with the review (and any tests the user asked for have been successfully run), write a brief summary of the changes in the bottom of docs/releaseNotes.md with the appropriate version number.
