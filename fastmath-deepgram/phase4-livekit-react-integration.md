# Phase 4: LiveKit React Integration Complete

## Overview

Phase 4 has been successfully implemented, replacing direct microphone access in the React components with LiveKit-based audio routing. This enables simultaneous speech recognition across three services:

1. **Web Speech API** - Runs directly in the browser
2. **Deepgram** - Processes audio via LiveKit → Server → Deepgram WebSocket
3. **Groq/Whisper** - Processes audio via LiveKit → Server → Groq API

## Key Components Created

### Frontend Components

1. **`TripleVoiceInputLiveKit.tsx`**
   - Replaces `DualVoiceInputV3.tsx`
   - Uses LiveKit client SDK for audio capture
   - Manages three speech recognition services simultaneously
   - Receives transcriptions from server via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Features:
     - Service toggles for each recognition engine
     - Real-time status indicators
     - Automatic submission logic for 3 services
     - LiveKit connection management

2. **`VoiceExerciseWithLiveKit.tsx`**
   - Replaces `VoiceExerciseWithComparison.tsx`
   - Integrates the triple voice input component
   - Manages exercise sessions with LiveKit
   - Tracks results from all three services

3. **`TranscriptionResultsTriple.tsx`**
   - Extended version of TranscriptionResults
   - Displays comparison data for three services
   - Shows accuracy, latency, and response time metrics
   - Determines the fastest/most accurate service

4. **Updated `DebugPanel.tsx`**
   - Now supports displaying data for three services
   - Shows Groq/Whisper status and metrics

### How It Works

1. **Connection Flow**:
   ```
   User Opens App
   ↓
   React Component Requests LiveKit Token
   ↓
   Backend Creates Token & Room Name
   ↓
   React Connects to LiveKit Room
   ↓
   Backend Services Join Same Room
   ↓
   User's Microphone → LiveKit → Backend Audio Router
   ```

2. **Audio Processing**:
   - Web Speech API: Processes audio directly in browser
   - Deepgram: Audio → LiveKit → Server → Deepgram WebSocket
   - Groq: Audio → LiveKit → Server → Buffer → Groq API (3s chunks)

3. **Transcription Flow**:
   - Server processes audio and extracts numbers
   - Results sent via SSE to React component
   - Component displays results in real-time
   - Auto-submission when all enabled services respond

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# LiveKit Configuration
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-instance.livekit.cloud

# Speech Recognition Services
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
```

### Testing the Integration

1. **Quick Test**:
   ```bash
   ./test-livekit-react.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Test**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   cd backend && npm run dev

   # Terminal 2: Start frontend  
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

3. **Verify Services**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Allow microphone access
   - Check LiveKit connection status (green indicator)
   - Speak a number and watch all three services respond

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Service Management**:
   - Individual service toggles
   - Real-time connection status
   - Graceful fallback handling

2. **Smart Auto-Submission**:
   - Single service enabled: Submit immediately on recognition
   - Multiple services: Submit when all respond OR after 5 seconds
   - Prevents duplicate submissions

3. **Latency Tracking**:
   - Speech start to recognition latency
   - Problem display to answer latency
   - Per-service metrics

4. **LiveKit Integration**:
   - Automatic room creation and management
   - Token-based authentication
   - Clean disconnection handling

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Centralized Audio Routing**: LiveKit acts as the single source of audio truth
2. **Scalability**: Can easily add more STT services
3. **Real-time Streaming**: Low-latency audio distribution
4. **Service Isolation**: Each service processes independently
5. **Comparison Capability**: Side-by-side performance metrics

## Next Steps (Phase 5 Preparation)

The implementation is ready for Phase 5, which will focus on:
1. Unified timestamp synchronization across all services
2. Enhanced latency calculations with LiveKit timestamps
3. Comprehensive performance analytics
4. Production optimization

## Usage

The application now provides a complete three-way comparison of speech recognition services:

1. **Web Speech API**: Browser's native speech recognition
2. **Deepgram**: Cloud-based streaming recognition
3. **Groq/Whisper**: OpenAI Whisper via Groq's fast inference

Users can:
- Toggle services on/off individually
- See real-time transcriptions from all services
- Compare accuracy and latency
- View detailed performance metrics after each session

## Troubleshooting

1. **LiveKit Connection Issues**:
   - Verify `.env` has correct LiveKit credentials
   - Check LiveKit server is accessible
   - Ensure WebRTC ports aren't blocked

2. **Service Not Responding**:
   - Check individual service API keys
   - Verify backend is running
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Audio Not Working**:
   - Ensure microphone permissions granted
   - Check LiveKit room is created
   - Verify backend joined the room

This completes Phase 4 of the LiveKit integration!
